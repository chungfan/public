# SwEnt Bootcamp

This bootcamp is an assignment for the [CS-311: Software Enterprise](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md) course.

## Learning Objectives

The goal is to get you started with Android development: you will set up your Android development environment and then build a simple (but real) Android application.
By the end, you will have the necessary knowledge and confidence to write Android applications and export them as packages for others to use.
In this bootcamp you will use the Jetpack Compose framework, and we strongly recommend that you continue using this framework for your project as well.

You will experience some of the pitfalls of real-world software engineering: dealing with ambiguous and incomplete documentation, working around bugs and limitations of third-party tools, organizing code for compliance and integration with blackbox pipelines, etc. You will start learning how to plan and estimate development time effectively, in order to stay on schedule despite these pitfalls.

## Structure

The `docs` folder contains all the provided information for doing the bootcamp; you will also need to use additional resources found on the Internet.
The `app` folder is where you will build your simple app.

While going through this bootcamp, keep in mind the [mandatory requirements](../README.md#app-requirements) for your project.
The bootcamp teaches you the basics for how to meet those requirements.

> [!TIP]
> We strongly recommend that you navigate the bootcamp documents via the GitHub website instead of locally on your laptop, so that you benefit from clickable links and GitHub-flavored markdown features, such as icons that emphasize special paragraphs like this one.

You can now proceed to the [ToDo app README](docs/ToDoApp/README.md).
Enjoy!
