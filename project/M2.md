# Project Milestone M2

_Last update: November 5, 2024_

Your project has three milestones (see the [project README](./README.md)), and this handout concerns the second milestone, named M2.

## Due Date

__15 minutes before__ the start of your Sprint Review on Friday, November 15, 2024

## Overview
At this stage, you've developed the foundation of your app and received initial feedback from your coaches to refine your coding practices and Scrum processes.
You now have a better understanding of how to collaborate with your teammates and ensure a smooth workflow.

M2 comprises primarily Sprints 3, 4, and 5. 

Do solicit informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches every week on how things are going. 
Aside from the weekly meeting, reach out to them on Discord or by email for asynchronous feedback.

## M2 Deliverables

Do not think of the milestone as some big deadline where you turn in everything you've done so far.
Instead, you should view it as a checkpoint on the way to your final goal.

Here is a list of items that your _team_ will need to prepare for M2, in order to make sure you're on-track.
These should already be familiar from the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md).


1. Updated Figma and architecture diagram reflecting the current state of your app ➡︎ linked from your project's _GitHub wiki_
2. Up-to-date Product Backlog<sup>3</sup> ➡︎ _GitHub Scrum board_
3. Sprint 6 Backlog with all tasks assigned, tagged, and estimated ➡︎ _GitHub Scrum board_
4. Code repo with functional CI pipeline, code analyzed by Sonar, tested with at least 2 meaningful end-to-end tests (including the one from M1), and >80% line test coverage ➡︎ _GitHub_
5. Working, stable APK generated by the CI, featuring at least one epic ➡︎ _GitHub_
6. Scrum process documents ➡︎ _Google sheets_ shared with swent-staff@dslab.org and linked from your GitHub wiki:
   - one documented stand-up meeting for each of the three Sprints
   - one documented Sprint Retrospective for each of the three Sprints
7. Implementation ➡︎ _GitHub_
   - uses ≥1 public cloud service (e.g., Firebase)
   - uses ≥1 phone sensor (e.g., GPS, camera, mic, ...)
   - has a concept of authentication

Additionally, each _individual_ team member should prepare the following:

1. An individual Retrospective for each of the three Sprints ➡︎ _Google sheet_ shared with swent-staff@dslab.org only, linked from your team's GitHub wiki
2. Code: ≥1 PR per Sprint, merged into `main`  ➡︎ _GitHub and [Moodle form](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1312161)_
3. Reviews: ≥1 reviewed PR per Sprint ➡︎ _GitHub and [Moodle form](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1312161)_

Enter in the Moodle form the PRs you created and were merged into `main`, as well as the PR reviews you completed.
Place the ones you are most proud of at the top, and your least favorite ones at the bottom.
We will look at all your PRs and reviews, to assess the overall consistency and quality of your contributions.
However, for the evaluation, we will start from the top of your list.

## Grading

The breakdown of the team and individual grades for M2 is as follows:

| **Total Team Grade**                            | **100%** |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Implementation (APK, code quality)              |   40%    |
| Features<sup>1</sup>                            |   20%    |
| Figma and architecture diagram                  |   15%    |
| Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog                |   10%    |
| Scrum process (documents, autonomy<sup>2</sup>) |   10%    |
| Consistent delivery of value<sup>3</sup>        |   5%     |

| **Total Individual Grade**   | **100%** |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Code PRs                     |   35%    |
| PR reviews                   |   30%    |
| Individual Retrospectives    |   10%    |
| Participation                |   10%    |
| Responsability               |   15%    |

<sup>1</sup>
We will evaluate the features you implemented.
We will want to see that you completed at least one [epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH4d5dYxSRM).
We will evaluate how well the features align with the overall goal of your app and the objectives of the course.

<sup>2</sup>
The goal of SwEnt is to enable you, as a team, to run a software project from A-to-Z on your own.
We therefore expect that you start to run and organize the Sprint Review and Retrospective on your own.
The coaches will watch and possibly ask questions.
Evaluation of your autonomy will include an assessment of your ability to define precise user stories, prioritize them in your PB, and scope them well enough to be broken down into Sprint tasks.
We will also evaluate your ability to take on the right amount of work and deliver by the end of the Sprint a concrete value Increment.

<sup>3</sup>
We will evaluate the Increment for each of your three Sprints and assess the amount of value it delivers to the app, from the perspective of the PB. You need to meaningfully increase the value of your app with every Sprint.

Remember that you can refer back to the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) if any of the items above are unclear.
