# Project Milestone M3

_Last updated: December 14, 2024_

Your project has three milestones (see the [project README](./README.md)), and this handout concerns the third and last milestone, named M3.

## Due Date

09:00 CET on Friday, December 20, 2024 

## Overview
M3 is the culmination of your hands-on journey in SwEnt, in which you transform your initial concept into a refined app ready for real users. This milestone carries the most weight among the three, as it evaluates not only the progress of the last five Sprints but also the final output of your entire course project. By now, you should have a solid command of Scrum methodology and collaborative teamwork. This is the final stretch, where you apply your skills to deliver a high-quality, user-ready application.

>[!NOTE]
> The Battle of the Apps (BOTA) is an optional competition in which your team presents their app to an audience consisting of your peers and outside visitors. The BOTA will take place on Thursday, 19.12.2024 from 10:15&mdash;13:00 in [STCC - Cloud C](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==STCC%207%208025).
The top-three teams will win substantial prizes!
Participation is entirely optional and will not impact your course grade.
We hope you all participate, either as a competitor or just as an audience member.

Do solicit informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches every week on how things are going. 
Aside from the weekly meeting, reach out to them on Discord or by email for asynchronous feedback.

## M3 Deliverables

Here is a list of items that your _team_ will need to prepare for M3.
These should already be familiar from the deliverables for [M1](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) and [M2](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md).


1. Up-to-date documentation of your app ➡︎ _GitHub wiki_
2. Code repo with functional CI pipeline, code analyzed by Sonar, tested with at least 4 meaningful end-to-end tests (including the ones from previous milestones), and >80% line test coverage ➡︎ _GitHub_
3. High-quality APK generated by the CI, featuring at least two epics, ready to run on any Android smartphone ➡︎ _GitHub_
4. Scrum process documents ➡︎ _Google sheets_ shared with swent-staff@dslab.org and linked from your GitHub wiki:
   - 1 documented stand-up meeting for each of the five Sprints
   - a documented Sprint Retrospective for each of the five Sprints
5. Implementation ➡︎ _GitHub_
   - has offline mode implemented
   - supports multiple users and authentication
   - uses ≥1 public cloud service (e.g., Firebase)
   - uses meaningfully ≥1 phone sensor (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, camera, mic, ...)

Additionally, each _individual_ team member should prepare the following:

1. An individual Retrospective for each of the five Sprints ➡︎ _Google sheet_ shared with swent-staff@dslab.org only, linked from your team's GitHub wiki
2. Code: ≥1 PR per Sprint  ➡︎ _GitHub and as per discussion with coaches_
3. Reviews: ≥1 reviewed PR per Sprint ➡︎ _GitHub and as per discussion with coaches_
4. Complete online survey ➡︎ _[Moodle survey (TODO)](TODO)_

## Grading

The breakdown of the team and individual grades for M3 is as follows:

| Code-PR reviews                                 |   30%    |
| Participation                                   |   15%    |

<sup>1</sup>
At the beginning of the course, we set the expectation that your app makes effective use of public cloud services, seamlessly transitions between online and offline mode, and makes meaningful use of the sensors. Feature-wise, it should have at least two meaningful epics implemented. We will evaluate if you have developed both epics and if their depth and complexity is in-line with expectations. We suggest that you revisit with your coaches what constitutes a meaningful epic and whether you are on track to meet expectations by the end of this milestone. The assessment will be primarily based on the APK, which is what users get.

<sup>2</sup>
Your app should work end-to-end seamlessly and coherently. Users should be able to create accounts, interact with the app and other users in natural and predictable ways, store and retrieve their data/information, be able to switch from one device to another, etc. The provided functionality should work reliably and survive the stress imposed by clueless users.

<sup>3</sup>
As a final release to put in the hands of real users, your app must have good usability. Ensure that the app is intuitive, allowing even first-time users to navigate easily without assistance. Focus on providing a streamlined experience that promotes seamless interaction with the app.

<sup>4</sup>
To make your code easy to understand, modify, and maintain, it must be modular, employ clear naming, and have concise functions.
Employ clean design patterns. 
Keep each function focused on a single responsibility, to improve readability and debugging.
Avoid large classes or methods by breaking down complex ones into smaller, reusable components. 
Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes, to convey their purpose at a glance.
Make sure you are consistent in the use of coding conventions. 

<sup>5</sup>
Your code repository should have comprehensive documentation across all levels of the app. 
This includes detailed inline comments, as well as an organized README that provides an overview of the app’s architecture and key components. 
The README should serve as a central guide, including resources like the Figma and the Architecture diagram, both of which should be up-to-date to accurately represent the app's final state. 
This documentation approach ensures that new contributors can quickly understand the app's structure and design, making onboarding and future development smoother.

Remember that many of the items above were explained in the deliverables for [M1](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) and [M2](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md), so do revisit them if anything is unclear.
