# Scrum Ceremonies

Every Friday morning, you will go through the three end-of-Sprint ceremonies together with your coaches: Review, Retrospective, and Planning.
These meetings are essential for maintaining the flow and efficiency of the team's work. 

The meetings must be purposeful, collaborative, and drive the project forward efficiently.
The secret to achieving this is preparation by the participants, which leads to:

- *Efficiency*: Well-prepared participants lead to shorter, more focused meetings.
- *Clarity*: Ensures that all team members are on the same page, reducing misunderstandings.
- *Actionability*: Helps in making decisions that are immediately actionable, as participants come with a clear understanding of the problems, goals, and constraints.
- *Continuous Improvement*: Especially in retrospectives, preparation enables the team to have meaningful discussions that drive ongoing improvements in processes and collaboration.

### 1. **Sprint Review**
   - **Purpose**: Inspect the work completed during the Sprint and gather feedback from stakeholders (your coaches, potentially other coaches, Prof. Candea).
   - **Preparation**:
     - _Dev Team_ prepares a demo of the Increment, i.e., the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the Sprint. You will need to work on this in advance (setup, demo script, etc.), to not waste people's time at the meeting. Budget 30 min to prepare the demo.
     - _Product Owner_ reviews the acceptance criteria for each user story to confirm that the work meets the definition of Done. 
     - _Stakeholders_ review any relevant information provided by the team in advance and prepare feedback or questions they might have during the review.

### 2. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - **Purpose**: Reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements for future Sprints.
   - **Preparation**:
     - _Scrum Master_ gathers data from the ongoing Sprint (e.g., burndown charts, velocity, any issues that arose) and prepares some structure for the Retrospective (e.g., "[Start, Stop, Continue](https://miro.com/templates/start-stop-continue/)").
     - _Team members_ reflect on the Sprint and consider:
       1. What went well;
       2. What didnâ€™t go well;
       3. What could be improved.


### 3. **Sprint Planning**
   - **Purpose**: Define what work will be accomplished in the upcoming Sprint.
   - **Preparation**:
     - _Product Owner_ prepares the Product Backlog, prioritizing user stories and ensuring that each story has clear acceptance criteria. The PO should be ready to discuss the rationale behind the prioritization and clarify any ambiguities.
     - _Dev Team_ reviews the PB before the meeting, familiarizing themselves with the user stories that will be pulled into the Sprint. Do as much of the breakdown into user stories as possible, and estimate effort (in person-hours) for each task.  Identify potential challenges or dependencies.
     - _Scrum Master_ gathers any relevant metrics or insights from previous sprints to inform the planning process. The SM thinks about how to best facilitate the planning session, to keep it focused and efficient.

Outside the ceremonies above, the there is one other ceremony that occurs multiple times during the Sprint (daily for full-time developers):

### **Daily Stand-Up (Daily Scrum)**
   - **Purpose**: To synchronize the team's work, discuss progress, and identify any obstacles.
   - **Preparation**: _Team Members_ prepare brief notes on three key points:
       1. What they accomplished since the last Stand-Up.
       2. What they plan to accomplish until the next Stand-Up.
       3. Any blockers or impediments they're facing.
