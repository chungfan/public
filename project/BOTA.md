# The Battle of the Apps (BOTA)

_Last updated: December 13, 2024_

The BOTA competition will allow you to showcase your app and compete with other teams for substantial prizes. It will take place on <b>Thursday, December 19, 2024</b> starting at <b>10:15</b> in STCC Cloud C.

Your course grade will not be affected by whether you participate in BOTA or how your demo goes. So, you might ask, why participate? The reason is that (hopefully) you haven't taken this course just to get a grade.
The BOTA is the culmination of <u>your</u> project, and it would be the first time you get to demo what you built in front of a big audience.
It is just plain cool and super satisfying to cap off this significant emotional and physical investment with a public demo.

## The Demo

A demo can serve many different purposes:
- engage stakeholders to support your efforts
- convince prospective users to get your app
- engage users for feedback
- ... etc.

Your goal at the BOTA will be to win the grand prize.
For that, you will have to (fairly) win the votes of the audience for having the coolest, most useful app.
So **think well who your audience is** and how to captivate them.

At the BOTA, your team will have a maximum of 5 minutes on stage (including any setup time) to demonstrate your app. 

A good demo typically starts with a quick pitch, which sets the context and develops a story: Who should use the app? What problem does the app solve for this audience? 
This sets the stage for a narrative around a typical user that your audience can **identify with**.
Then make a case for why the audience should use your app.
What differentiates your app from the thousands of other apps out there that do the same (or similar) things?
During the demo, focus on the key features that make your app special.
Demonstrate these key features live, in order to show their ease and impact.

For instance, you might ask the audience to imagine they're at the end of a long work day... _You're looking for a quick yet healthy meal option.
What cuisine are you in the mood for? Italian? OK!
Let's find your dinner using PolyFood._
Then show how the app works on a real device.
_Watch how PolyFood narrows down the best Italian restaurants nearby, with top-rated dishes highlighted.
Aha, check out the AI suggesting a tiramisu to go with your meal. Nice!
With a few simple taps, you can select all this, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout.
Notice how seamless and intuitive the process is._ And so on...

**Preparation is key**.
There is no such thing as a "spontaneous demo" that is effective.
Ensure your app is fully functional and any necessary supporting materials (slides, video clip, etc.) are ready.
Anticipate technical issues and have backups in place.

You will demo your app using 1 or 2 phones, your choice.
No emulators.
You will screencast your phone(s) using the SwEnt Discord, which we will then display on the big screen.
There will be one computer connected to each of the two big screens.
From your phone, you will need to join the `#BOTA` channel, then screen-share your app to the channel.
By default, this form of screencasting will not make the taps on your phone visible, so the audience will not know what you're doing on the phone&mdash;we recommend that you either [enable "Show taps"](https://support.screenpal.com/portal/en/kb/articles/show-finger-taps-when-recording-on-your-android-device) or adapt the script of your demo accordingly.
Consider coming to Cloud C between 9:30-10:00, before the BOTA, for an end-to-end test of your Discord setup.
We will have to cut trials off at 10:00, so we can get the final preparations done.

During the demo, **be original**&mdash;think of doing something that no other team will do.
Think of what your strengths are, and capitalize on them: Are you good at putting on a show on stage? Does your app do amazing things? Do you have some cool props that will make your demo memorable?
What is it that thing that only you can do/show and nobody else?

Engage the audience and try to interact with them during the demo.

As you think about how to do the demo, you might consider checking out these demos that have become legendary due to their innovation, impact, and ability to capture the imagination of audiences:
- [Steve Jobs unveiling the iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o) (2007): An iconic demo that introduced a product that redefined an entire industry. 
- [Invest in malaria prevention](https://youtu.be/ZLkbWUNQbgk?si=YWUxtMmuIRybRJoF&t=235) (2013): Bill Gates theatrically engages the audience emotionally to feel his cause... "There's no reason only poor people should have the experience."
- [Google's AI assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM) (2018): At the time, having an AI speak in a natural, human-like manner and adapt to unforeseen situations offered a vision of the future that was very exciting. All this, despite the less than charismatic presenter.


## Participation

To sign up for participation, go to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PFXokDA03V1tDupfZQT8e8qROSqU0c4d3duxX6rcYtw/edit?usp=sharing) and claim a slot right away, but no later than 23:59 on the Monday before the BOTA.
You will need to provide the official name of your team, the offical name of your app, a 1-sentence description of the app (make it meaningful, not just some marketing gobbledygook), and a link to one screenshot that is representative of the app (this screenshot will be used to identify the app for the audience, so make sure that it's distinctive).

At the BOTA, while one team is demo-ing, we expect the next team to get ready.

The BOTA will not be video-recorded or streamed. If you would like this to happen, then please take charge of suitable arrangements and coordinate with us beforehand.

Any team is free to participate.
Coaches will additionally nominate specific teams for participation. These teams are free to refuse to participate.

We recommend that a maximum of 2 members of your team do the demo, but you're free to use as many people as you want.
It would be ideal for the entire team to attend the event and support their teammates.

## The Audience 

The BOTA will be attended primarily by SwEnt students.

If you are in the audience, you will get to vote, as a team, by filling in an online form. Each team will have a total of 30 points to distribute in the following way: 12 points for their top choice, 10 points for their 2nd choice, and 8 points for their 3rd choice. Together with the vote, you can submit a 1-sentence "nomination statement" that explains why you chose that particular team for that particular spot in your rankings.

>[!NOTE]
> Consider sitting together as a team; this will make the decision process easier.

Votes will remain anonymous to the audience, but not to the staff. You cannot vote for your own team, and you cannot vote more than once. Please vote carefully, because the staff will disqualify all votes that violate the rules.

The results of the votes will be revealed on the big screen, one vote at a time. The optional nomination statements will be read out loud (except for inappropriate ones) during the reveal.

The staff will vote only if necessary to break ties in the top-3 ranking.
The coaches of the tied teams will not vote in such a tie-breaker.

## The Prizes

Preparing for and participating in this competition is a reward in and of itself, and everyone who participates wins the experience.

Additionally, we will reward the top three teams as follows:

|                              |   Prize   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Team in 1<sup>st</sup> place | 500-CHF Digitec gift certificate |
| Team in 2<sup>nd</sup> place | 300-CHF Digitec gift certificate |
| Team in 3<sup>rd</sup> place | 150-CHF Digitec gift certificate |

Everyone who comes to the BOTA will receive a SwEnt sticker for their laptop. We hope all students in SwEnt will come, including those whose teams are not demo-ing their app.
